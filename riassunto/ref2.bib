    abstract = "{Recent millimetre-wavelength surveys performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) have revealed protoplanetary discs characterized by rings and gaps. A possible explanation for the origin of such rings is the tidal interaction with an unseen planetary companion. The protoplanetary disc around DS Tau shows a wide gap in the ALMA observation at 1.3 mm. We construct a hydrodynamical model for the dust continuum observed by ALMA assuming the observed gap is carved by a planet between one and five Jupiter masses. We fit the shape of the radial intensity profile along the disc major axis varying the planet mass, the dust disc mass, and the evolution time of the system. The best-fitting model is obtained for a planet with \\$M\_\\{\\rm p\\}=3.5\\, \\mathrm\\{ M\\}\_\\{\\rm Jup\\}\\$ and a disc with \\$M\_\\{\\rm dust\\}= 9.6\\,\\times \\,10^\\{-5\\}\\, \\mathrm\\{ M\\}\_\\{\\odot \\}\\$. Starting from this result, we also compute the expected signature of the planet in the gas kinematics, as traced by CO emission. We find that such a signature (in the form of a ‘kink’ in the channel maps) could be observed by ALMA with a velocity resolution between \\$0.2-0.5\\, \\rm \\{kms\\}^\\{-1\\}\\$ and a beam size between 30 and 50 mas.}",

    abstract = "{We identify two distinct physical mechanisms for dust gap opening by embedded planets in protoplanetary discs based on the symmetry of the drag-induced motion around the planet: (I) a mechanism where low-mass planets, that do not disturb the gas, open gaps in dust by tidal torques assisted by drag in the inner disc, but resisted by drag in the outer disc; and (II) the usual, drag-assisted, mechanism where higher mass planets create pressure maxima in the gas disc, which the drag torque then acts to evacuate further in the dust. The first mechanism produces gaps in dust but not gas, while the second produces partial or total gas gaps which are deeper in the dust phase. Dust gaps do not necessarily indicate gas gaps.}",

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We present the results of numerical simulations of protostellar accretion disks that are perturbed by a protoplanetary companion that has a much smaller mass than the central object. We consider the limiting cases where the companion is in a coplanar, circular orbit and is initially embedded in the disk. Three independent numerical schemes are employed, and generic features of the flow are found in each case. In the first series of idealized models, the secondary companion is modeled as a massless, orbiting sink hole able to absorb all matter incident upon it without exerting any gravitational torque on the disk. In these simulations, accretion onto the companion induces surface density depression and gap formation centered on its orbital radius. After an initial transitory adjustment, the accretion rate onto the sink hole becomes regulated by the rate at which viscous evolution of the disk can cause matter to diffuse into the vicinity of the sink hole orbit, and thus the sink hole grows on a disk viscous timescale. In the second series of comprehensive models, the companion's gravity is included. When the tidal torque exerted by the companion on the disk becomes important, the angular momentum exchange rate between the companion and the disk induces the protoplanetary accretion to reduce markedly below that in the idealized sink hole models. Whether this process is effective in inhibiting protoplanetary accretion depends on the equation of state and disk model parameters. For polytropic or isothermal equations of state, we find, in basic agreement with earlier work, that when the mean Roche lobe radius of the companion exceeds the disk thickness and when the mass ratio, q, between the companion and the central object exceeds ~40/ℛ, where ℛ is the effective Reynolds number, a clean deep gap forms. Although precise estimation is rendered difficult due to the limitation of numerical schemes in dealing with large density contrasts, the generic results of three series of simulations indicate that accretion onto sufficiently massive protoplanets can become ineffective over the expected disk lifetimes in their neighborhood. We suggest that such a process operates during planetary formation and is important in determining the final mass of giant planets.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {A giant planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk forms a gap. An analytic relationship among the gap depth, planet mass Mp, disk aspect ratio hp, and viscosity α has been found recently, and the gap depth can be written in terms of a single parameter . We discuss how observed gap features can be used to constrain the disk and/or planet parameters based on the analytic formula for the gap depth. The constraint on the disk aspect ratio is critical in determining the planet mass so the combination of the observations of the temperature and the image can provide a constraint on the planet mass. We apply the formula for the gap depth to observations of HL Tau and HD 169142. In the case of HL Tau, we propose that a planet with  MJ is responsible for the observed gap at 30 AU from the central star based on the estimate that the gap depth is . In the case of HD 169142, the planet mass that causes the gap structure recently found by VLA is . We also argue that the spiral structure, if observed, can be used to estimate the lower limit of the disk aspect ratio and the planet mass.}
