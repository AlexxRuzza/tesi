    abstract = "{Recent millimetre-wavelength surveys performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) have revealed protoplanetary discs characterized by rings and gaps. A possible explanation for the origin of such rings is the tidal interaction with an unseen planetary companion. The protoplanetary disc around DS Tau shows a wide gap in the ALMA observation at 1.3 mm. We construct a hydrodynamical model for the dust continuum observed by ALMA assuming the observed gap is carved by a planet between one and five Jupiter masses. We fit the shape of the radial intensity profile along the disc major axis varying the planet mass, the dust disc mass, and the evolution time of the system. The best-fitting model is obtained for a planet with \\$M\_\\{\\rm p\\}=3.5\\, \\mathrm\\{ M\\}\_\\{\\rm Jup\\}\\$ and a disc with \\$M\_\\{\\rm dust\\}= 9.6\\,\\times \\,10^\\{-5\\}\\, \\mathrm\\{ M\\}\_\\{\\odot \\}\\$. Starting from this result, we also compute the expected signature of the planet in the gas kinematics, as traced by CO emission. We find that such a signature (in the form of a ‘kink’ in the channel maps) could be observed by ALMA with a velocity resolution between \\$0.2-0.5\\, \\rm \\{kms\\}^\\{-1\\}\\$ and a beam size between 30 and 50 mas.}",

    abstract = { The disks that orbit young stars are the essential conduits and reservoirs of material for star and planet formation. Their structures, meaning the spatial variations of the disk physical conditions, reflect the underlying mechanisms that drive those formation processes. Observations of the solids and gas in these disks, particularly at high resolution, provide fundamental insights on their mass distributions, dynamical states, and evolutionary behaviors. Over the past decade, rapid developments in these areas have largely been driven by observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This review highlights the state of observational research on disk structures, emphasizing the following three key conclusions that reflect the main branches of the field: ▪ Relationships among disk structure properties are also linked to the masses, environments, and evolutionary states of their stellar hosts. ▪ There is clear, qualitative evidence for the growth and migration of disk solids, although the implied evolutionary timescales suggest the classical assumption of a smooth gas disk is inappropriate. ▪ Small-scale substructures with a variety of morphologies, locations, scales, and amplitudes—presumably tracing local gas pressure maxima—broadly influence the physical and observational properties of disks.The last point especially is reshaping the field, with the recognition that these disk substructures likely trace active sites of planetesimal growth or are the hallmarks of planetary systems at their formation epoch. }

An analytic relationship among the gap depth, planet mass Mp, disk aspect ratio hp, and viscosity α has been found recently, and the gap depth can be written in terms of a single parameter . We discuss how observed gap features can be used to constrain the disk and/or planet parameters based on the analytic formula for the gap depth. The constraint on the disk aspect ratio is critical in determining the planet mass so the combination of the observations of the temperature and the image can provide a constraint on the planet mass. We apply the formula for the gap depth to observations of HL Tau and HD 169142. In the case of HL Tau, we propose that a planet with  MJ is responsible for the observed gap at 30 AU from the central star based on the estimate that the gap depth is . In the case of HD 169142, the planet mass that causes the gap structure recently found by VLA is . We also argue that the spiral structure, if observed, can be used to estimate the lower limit of the disk aspect ratio and the planet mass.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Rings are the most frequently revealed substructure in Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) dust observations of protoplanetary disks, but their origin is still hotly debated. In this paper, we identify dust substructures in 12 disks and measure their properties to investigate how they form. This subsample of disks is selected from a high-resolution (∼0.″12) ALMA 1.33 mm survey of 32 disks in the Taurus star-forming region, which was designed to cover a wide range of brightness and to be unbiased to previously known substructures. While axisymmetric rings and gaps are common within our sample, spiral patterns and high-contrast azimuthal asymmetries are not detected. Fits of disk models to the visibilities lead to estimates of the location and shape of gaps and rings, the flux in each disk component, and the size of the disk. The dust substructures occur across a wide range of stellar mass and disk brightness. Disks with multiple rings tend to be more massive and more extended. The correlation between gap locations and widths, the intensity contrast between rings and gaps, and the separations of rings and gaps could all be explained if most gaps are opened by low-mass planets (super-Earths and Neptunes) in the condition of low disk turbulence (α = 10−4). The gap locations are not well correlated with the expected locations of CO and N2 ice lines, so condensation fronts are unlikely to be a universal mechanism to create gaps and rings, though they may play a role in some cases.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We present the results of numerical simulations of protostellar accretion disks that are perturbed by a protoplanetary companion that has a much smaller mass than the central object. We consider the limiting cases where the companion is in a coplanar, circular orbit and is initially embedded in the disk. Three independent numerical schemes are employed, and generic features of the flow are found in each case. In the first series of idealized models, the secondary companion is modeled as a massless, orbiting sink hole able to absorb all matter incident upon it without exerting any gravitational torque on the disk. In these simulations, accretion onto the companion induces surface density depression and gap formation centered on its orbital radius. After an initial transitory adjustment, the accretion rate onto the sink hole becomes regulated by the rate at which viscous evolution of the disk can cause matter to diffuse into the vicinity of the sink hole orbit, and thus the sink hole grows on a disk viscous timescale. In the second series of comprehensive models, the companion's gravity is included. When the tidal torque exerted by the companion on the disk becomes important, the angular momentum exchange rate between the companion and the disk induces the protoplanetary accretion to reduce markedly below that in the idealized sink hole models. Whether this process is effective in inhibiting protoplanetary accretion depends on the equation of state and disk model parameters. For polytropic or isothermal equations of state, we find, in basic agreement with earlier work, that when the mean Roche lobe radius of the companion exceeds the disk thickness and when the mass ratio, q, between the companion and the central object exceeds ~40/ℛ, where ℛ is the effective Reynolds number, a clean deep gap forms. Although precise estimation is rendered difficult due to the limitation of numerical schemes in dealing with large density contrasts, the generic results of three series of simulations indicate that accretion onto sufficiently massive protoplanets can become ineffective over the expected disk lifetimes in their neighborhood. We suggest that such a process operates during planetary formation and is important in determining the final mass of giant planets.}

To explore this scenario, we combine two-dimensional two fluid (gas + particle) hydrodynamical calculations with three-dimensional Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer simulations and study the observational signatures of gaps opened by one or several planets, making qualitative comparisons with observations. We find that a single planet as small as 0.2 can produce a deep gap at millimeter wavelengths and almost no features at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, while multiple planets can open up a few ×10 AU wide common gap at both wavelengths. Both the contrast ratio of the gaps and the wavelength dependence of the gap sizes are broadly consistent with data. We also confirm previous results that NIR gap sizes may be smaller than millimeter gap sizes due to dust–gas coupling and radiative transfer effects. When viewed at a moderate inclination angle, a physically circular on-centered gap could appear to be off-centered from the star due to shadowing. Planet-induced spiral arms are more apparent at NIR than at millimeter wavelengths. Overall, our results suggest that the planet-opening-gap scenario is a promising way to explain the origin of the transitional disks. Finally, inspired by the recent Atacama Large Millimeter Array release of the image of the HL Tau disk, we show that multiple narrow gaps, well separated by bright rings, can be opened by planets soon after their formation in a relatively massive disk.}

We present deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maps of the J = 2−1 transition of 12CO, 13CO, and C18O, as well as the J = 3−2 transition of DCO+, toward the T Tauri star RU Lup at a resolution of ∼0.3″ (∼50 au). The CO isotopologue emission traces four major components of the RU Lup system: a compact Keplerian disk with a radius of ∼120 au, a non-Keplerian “envelope-like” structure surrounding the disk and extending to ∼260 au from the star, at least five blueshifted spiral arms stretching up to 1000 au, and clumps outside the spiral arms located up to 1500 au in projection from RU Lup. We comment on potential explanations for RU Lup’s peculiar gas morphology, including gravitational instability, accretion of material onto the disk, or perturbation by another star. RU Lup’s extended non-Keplerian CO emission, elevated stellar accretion rate, and unusual photometric variability suggest that it could be a scaled-down Class II analog of the outbursting FU Ori systems.}

	abstract = {We report 0.″14 resolution observations of the dust continuum at band 7, and the CO(3–2) and HCO+(4–3) line emissions toward the transitional disk around Sz 91 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The dust disk appears to be an axisymmetric ring, peaking at a radius of ∼95 au from a Gaussian fit. The Gaussian fit widths of the dust ring are 24.6 and 23.7 au for the major and the minor axes, respectively, indicating that the dust ring is not geometrically thin. The gas disk extends out to ∼320 au and is also detected in the inner hole of the dust ring. A twin-line pattern is found in the channel maps of CO, which can be interpreted as the emission from the front and rear of the flared gas disk. We perform radiative transfer calculations using RADMC-3D to check whether the twin-line pattern can be reproduced assuming that the flared gas disk has a power-law form for the column density and Tgas = Tdust. The thermal Monte Carlo calculation in RADMC-3D shows that the disk temperature has a gradient along the vertical direction beyond the dust ring, as it blocks the stellar radiation, and thus the twin-line pattern can be naturally explained by the flared gas disk in combination with the dust ring. In addition, no significant depletion of the CO molecules in the cold midplane achieves a reasonable agreement with the observed twin-line pattern. This result indicates that the CO emission from the rear surface must be heavily absorbed in the cold midplane.}

We present new, sensitive observations of the 12CO J = 3 − 2 line at a spatial resolution of 8 au (0.″14). The CO emission exhibits a bright inner core, a shoulder at r ≈ 70 au, and a prominent break in slope at r ≈ 90 au. Radiative transfer modeling is used to demonstrate that the emission morphology can be reasonably reproduced with a 12CO column density profile featuring a steep decrease at r ≈ 15 au and a secondary bump peaking at r ≈ 70 au. Similar features have been identified in observations of rarer CO isotopologues, which trace heights closer to the midplane. Substructure in the underlying gas distribution or radially varying CO depletion that affects much of the disk’s vertical extent may explain the shared emission features of the main CO isotopologues. We also combine archival 1.3 mm and 870 μm continuum observations to produce a spectral index map at a spatial resolution of 2 au. The spectral index rises sharply at the continuum emission gaps at radii of 25, 41, and 47 au. This behavior suggests that the grains within the gaps are no larger than a few millimeters. Outside the continuum gaps, the low spectral index values of α ≈ 2 indicate either that grains up to centimeter size are present or that the bright continuum rings are marginally optically thick at millimeter wavelengths.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Low brightness dips have recently been observed in images of protoplanetary disks, and they are believed to be shadows by the inner disk. We present VLT/SPHERE polarimetric differential imaging of the transition disk around the dipper star RX J1604.3–2130. We gathered 11 epochs that cover a large temporal baseline, to search for variability over timescales of years, months, weeks, and days. Our observations unambiguously reveal two dips along an almost face-on narrow ring (with a width of ∼20 au), and the location of the peak of this ring is at ∼65 au. The ring lies inside the ring-like structure observed with ALMA, which peaks at ∼83 au. This segregation can result from particle trapping in pressure bumps, potentially due to planet(s). We find that the dips are variable, both in morphology and in position. The eastern dip, at a position angle (PA) of ∼83.°7 ± 13.°7, has an amplitude that varies between 40% to 90%, and its angular width varies from 10° to 34°. The western dip, at a PA of ∼265.°90 ± 13.°0, is more variable, with amplitude and width variations of 31% to 95% and 12° to 53°, respectively. The separation between the dips is 178.°3 ± 14.°5, corresponding to a large misalignment between the inner and outer disks, supporting the classification of J1604 as an aperiodic dipper. The variability indicates that the innermost regions are highly dynamic, possibly due to a massive companion or to a complex magnetic field topology.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {In order to look for signs of ongoing planet formation in young disks, we carried out the first J-band polarized emission imaging of the Herbig Ae/Be stars HD 150193, HD 163296, and HD 169142 using the Gemini Planet Imager, along with new H band observations of HD 144432. We confirm the complex “double ring” structure for the nearly face-on system HD 169142 first seen in H-band, finding the outer ring to be substantially redder than the inner one in polarized intensity. Using radiative transfer modeling, we developed a physical model that explains the full spectral energy distribution and J- and H-band surface brightness profiles, suggesting that the differential color of the two rings could come from reddened starlight traversing the inner wall and may not require differences in grain properties. In addition, we clearly detect an elongated, off-center ring in HD 163296 (MWC 275), locating the scattering surface to be 18 au above the midplane at a radial distance of 77 au, co-spatial with a ring seen at 1.3 mm by ALMA linked to the CO snow line. Lastly, we report a weak tentative detection of scattered light for HD 150193 (MWC 863) and a non-detection for HD 144432; the stellar companion known for each of these targets has likely disrupted the material in the outer disk of the primary star. For HD 163296 and HD 169142, the prominent outer rings we detect could be evidence for giant planet formation in the outer disk or a manifestation of large-scale dust growth processes possibly related to snow-line chemistry.}

	title = {Dust-trapping Vortices and a Potentially Planet-triggered Spiral Wake in the Pre-transitional Disk of V1247 Orionis},
	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {The radial drift problem constitutes one of the most fundamental problems in planet formation theory, as it predicts particles to drift into the star before they are able to grow to planetesimal size. Dust-trapping vortices have been proposed as a possible solution to this problem, as they might be able to trap particles over millions of years, allowing them to grow beyond the radial drift barrier. Here, we present ALMA 0.″04 resolution imaging of the pre-transitional disk of V1247 Orionis that reveals an asymmetric ring as well as a sharply confined crescent structure, resembling morphologies seen in theoretical models of vortex formation. The asymmetric ring (at 0.″17 = 54 au separation from the star) and the crescent (at 0.″38 = 120 au) seem smoothly connected through a one-armed spiral-arm structure that has been found previously in scattered light. We propose a physical scenario with a planet orbiting at ∼0.″3 ≈ 100 au, where the one-armed spiral arm detected in polarized light traces the accretion stream feeding the protoplanet. The dynamical influence of the planet clears the gap between the ring and the crescent and triggers two vortices that trap millimeter-sized particles, namely, the crescent and the bright asymmetry seen in the ring. We conducted dedicated hydrodynamics simulations of a disk with an embedded planet, which results in similar spiral-arm morphologies as seen in our scattered-light images. At the position of the spiral wake and the crescent we also observe 12CO(3-2) and H12CO+ (4-3) excess line emission, likely tracing the increased scale-height in these disk regions.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We study the behavior of magnetorotational turbulence in shearing box simulations with a radial and azimuthal extent up to 10 scale heights. Maxwell and Reynolds stresses are found to increase by more than a factor of 2 when increasing the box size beyond two scale heights in the radial direction. Further increase of the box size has little or no effect on the statistical properties of the turbulence. An inverse cascade excites magnetic field structures at the largest scales of the box. The corresponding 10% variation in the Maxwell stress launches a zonal flow of alternating sub- and super-Keplerian velocity. This, in turn, generates a banded density structure in geostrophic balance between pressure and Coriolis forces. We present a simplified model for the appearance of zonal flows, in which stochastic forcing by the magnetic tension on short timescales creates zonal flow structures with lifetimes of several tens of orbits. We experiment with various improved shearing box algorithms to reduce the numerical diffusivity introduced by the supersonic shear flow. While a standard finite difference advection scheme shows signs of a suppression of turbulent activity near the edges of the box, this problem is eliminated by a new method where the Keplerian shear advection is advanced in time by interpolation in Fourier space.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {The instability in protoplanetary disks due to gas–dust friction and self-gravity of gas and dust is investigated using linear analysis. In the case where the dust-to-gas ratio is enhanced and turbulence is weak, the instability grows, even in gravitationally stable disks, on a timescale of order 104–5 yr at a radius of order 100 AU. If we ignore the dynamical feedback from dust grains in the gas equation of motion, the instability reduces to the so-called “secular gravitational instability,” which was investigated previously to be an instability of dust in a fixed background gas flow. In this work, we solve the equations of motion for both gas and dust consistently and find that long-wavelength perturbations are stable, in contrast to the secular gravitational instability in the simplified treatment. This may indicate that we should not neglect small terms in the equation of motion if the growth rate is small. The instability is expected to form ring structures in protoplanetary disks. The width of the ring formed at a radius of 100 AU is a few tens of AU. Therefore, the instability is a candidate for the formation mechanism of observed ring-like structures in disks. Another aspect of the instability is the accumulation of dust grains, and hence the instability may play an important role in the formation of planetesimals, rocky protoplanets, and cores of gas giants located at radii ∼100 AU. If these objects survive the dispersal of the gaseous component of the disk, they may be the origin of debris disks.}

Here we analyze ALMA long baseline 2.9, 1.3 and 0.87 mm continuum images of the young star HL Tau, and suggest that the emission dips observed are due to rapid pebble growth around the condensation fronts of abundant volatile species. Specifically, we show that the prominent innermost dip at 13 AU is spatially resolved in the 0.87 mm image, and its center radius is coincident with the expected mid-plane condensation front of water ice. In addition, two other prominent dips, at distances of 32 and 63 AU, cover the mid-plane condensation fronts of pure ammonia or ammonia hydrates and clathrate hydrates (especially with CO and N2) formed from amorphous water ice. The spectral index map of HL Tau between 1.3 and 0.87 mm shows that the flux ratios inside the dips are statistically larger than those of nearby regions in the disk. This variation can be explained by a model with two dust populations, where most of the solid mass resides in a component that has grown to decimeter size scales inside the dips. Such growth is in accord with recent numerical simulations of volatile condensation, dust coagulation, and settling.}

To better understand the planet formation process, the next step is the detection of forming planets or of signposts of young planets still in their disc, such as gaps. A spectacular example is the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) science verification image of HL Tau showing numerous gaps and rings in its disc. To study the observability of planet gaps, we ran 3D hydrodynamical simulations of a gas and dust disc containing a 5 MJ gap-opening planet and characterized the spatial distribution of migrating, growing and fragmenting dust grains. We then computed the corresponding synthetic images for ALMA. For a value of the dust fragmentation threshold of 15 m s−1 for the collisional velocity, we identify for the first time a self-induced dust pile-up in simulations taking fragmentation into account. This feature, in addition to the easily detected planet gap, causes a second apparent gap that could be mistaken for the signature of a second planet. It is therefore essential to be cautious in the interpretation of gap detections.}",
