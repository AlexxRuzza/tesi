    abstract = "{Recent millimetre-wavelength surveys performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) have revealed protoplanetary discs characterized by rings and gaps. A possible explanation for the origin of such rings is the tidal interaction with an unseen planetary companion. The protoplanetary disc around DS Tau shows a wide gap in the ALMA observation at 1.3 mm. We construct a hydrodynamical model for the dust continuum observed by ALMA assuming the observed gap is carved by a planet between one and five Jupiter masses. We fit the shape of the radial intensity profile along the disc major axis varying the planet mass, the dust disc mass, and the evolution time of the system. The best-fitting model is obtained for a planet with \\$M\_\\{\\rm p\\}=3.5\\, \\mathrm\\{ M\\}\_\\{\\rm Jup\\}\\$ and a disc with \\$M\_\\{\\rm dust\\}= 9.6\\,\\times \\,10^\\{-5\\}\\, \\mathrm\\{ M\\}\_\\{\\odot \\}\\$. Starting from this result, we also compute the expected signature of the planet in the gas kinematics, as traced by CO emission. We find that such a signature (in the form of a ‘kink’ in the channel maps) could be observed by ALMA with a velocity resolution between \\$0.2-0.5\\, \\rm \\{kms\\}^\\{-1\\}\\$ and a beam size between 30 and 50 mas.}",

    abstract = { The disks that orbit young stars are the essential conduits and reservoirs of material for star and planet formation. Their structures, meaning the spatial variations of the disk physical conditions, reflect the underlying mechanisms that drive those formation processes. Observations of the solids and gas in these disks, particularly at high resolution, provide fundamental insights on their mass distributions, dynamical states, and evolutionary behaviors. Over the past decade, rapid developments in these areas have largely been driven by observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This review highlights the state of observational research on disk structures, emphasizing the following three key conclusions that reflect the main branches of the field: ▪ Relationships among disk structure properties are also linked to the masses, environments, and evolutionary states of their stellar hosts. ▪ There is clear, qualitative evidence for the growth and migration of disk solids, although the implied evolutionary timescales suggest the classical assumption of a smooth gas disk is inappropriate. ▪ Small-scale substructures with a variety of morphologies, locations, scales, and amplitudes—presumably tracing local gas pressure maxima—broadly influence the physical and observational properties of disks.The last point especially is reshaping the field, with the recognition that these disk substructures likely trace active sites of planetesimal growth or are the hallmarks of planetary systems at their formation epoch. }

An analytic relationship among the gap depth, planet mass Mp, disk aspect ratio hp, and viscosity α has been found recently, and the gap depth can be written in terms of a single parameter . We discuss how observed gap features can be used to constrain the disk and/or planet parameters based on the analytic formula for the gap depth. The constraint on the disk aspect ratio is critical in determining the planet mass so the combination of the observations of the temperature and the image can provide a constraint on the planet mass. We apply the formula for the gap depth to observations of HL Tau and HD 169142. In the case of HL Tau, we propose that a planet with  MJ is responsible for the observed gap at 30 AU from the central star based on the estimate that the gap depth is . In the case of HD 169142, the planet mass that causes the gap structure recently found by VLA is . We also argue that the spiral structure, if observed, can be used to estimate the lower limit of the disk aspect ratio and the planet mass.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Rings are the most frequently revealed substructure in Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) dust observations of protoplanetary disks, but their origin is still hotly debated. In this paper, we identify dust substructures in 12 disks and measure their properties to investigate how they form. This subsample of disks is selected from a high-resolution (∼0.″12) ALMA 1.33 mm survey of 32 disks in the Taurus star-forming region, which was designed to cover a wide range of brightness and to be unbiased to previously known substructures. While axisymmetric rings and gaps are common within our sample, spiral patterns and high-contrast azimuthal asymmetries are not detected. Fits of disk models to the visibilities lead to estimates of the location and shape of gaps and rings, the flux in each disk component, and the size of the disk. The dust substructures occur across a wide range of stellar mass and disk brightness. Disks with multiple rings tend to be more massive and more extended. The correlation between gap locations and widths, the intensity contrast between rings and gaps, and the separations of rings and gaps could all be explained if most gaps are opened by low-mass planets (super-Earths and Neptunes) in the condition of low disk turbulence (α = 10−4). The gap locations are not well correlated with the expected locations of CO and N2 ice lines, so condensation fronts are unlikely to be a universal mechanism to create gaps and rings, though they may play a role in some cases.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We present the results of numerical simulations of protostellar accretion disks that are perturbed by a protoplanetary companion that has a much smaller mass than the central object. We consider the limiting cases where the companion is in a coplanar, circular orbit and is initially embedded in the disk. Three independent numerical schemes are employed, and generic features of the flow are found in each case. In the first series of idealized models, the secondary companion is modeled as a massless, orbiting sink hole able to absorb all matter incident upon it without exerting any gravitational torque on the disk. In these simulations, accretion onto the companion induces surface density depression and gap formation centered on its orbital radius. After an initial transitory adjustment, the accretion rate onto the sink hole becomes regulated by the rate at which viscous evolution of the disk can cause matter to diffuse into the vicinity of the sink hole orbit, and thus the sink hole grows on a disk viscous timescale. In the second series of comprehensive models, the companion's gravity is included. When the tidal torque exerted by the companion on the disk becomes important, the angular momentum exchange rate between the companion and the disk induces the protoplanetary accretion to reduce markedly below that in the idealized sink hole models. Whether this process is effective in inhibiting protoplanetary accretion depends on the equation of state and disk model parameters. For polytropic or isothermal equations of state, we find, in basic agreement with earlier work, that when the mean Roche lobe radius of the companion exceeds the disk thickness and when the mass ratio, q, between the companion and the central object exceeds ~40/ℛ, where ℛ is the effective Reynolds number, a clean deep gap forms. Although precise estimation is rendered difficult due to the limitation of numerical schemes in dealing with large density contrasts, the generic results of three series of simulations indicate that accretion onto sufficiently massive protoplanets can become ineffective over the expected disk lifetimes in their neighborhood. We suggest that such a process operates during planetary formation and is important in determining the final mass of giant planets.}

To explore this scenario, we combine two-dimensional two fluid (gas + particle) hydrodynamical calculations with three-dimensional Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer simulations and study the observational signatures of gaps opened by one or several planets, making qualitative comparisons with observations. We find that a single planet as small as 0.2 can produce a deep gap at millimeter wavelengths and almost no features at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, while multiple planets can open up a few ×10 AU wide common gap at both wavelengths. Both the contrast ratio of the gaps and the wavelength dependence of the gap sizes are broadly consistent with data. We also confirm previous results that NIR gap sizes may be smaller than millimeter gap sizes due to dust–gas coupling and radiative transfer effects. When viewed at a moderate inclination angle, a physically circular on-centered gap could appear to be off-centered from the star due to shadowing. Planet-induced spiral arms are more apparent at NIR than at millimeter wavelengths. Overall, our results suggest that the planet-opening-gap scenario is a promising way to explain the origin of the transitional disks. Finally, inspired by the recent Atacama Large Millimeter Array release of the image of the HL Tau disk, we show that multiple narrow gaps, well separated by bright rings, can be opened by planets soon after their formation in a relatively massive disk.}

The CO isotopologue emission traces four major components of the RU Lup system: a compact Keplerian disk with a radius of ∼120 au, a non-Keplerian “envelope-like” structure surrounding the disk and extending to ∼260 au from the star, at least five blueshifted spiral arms stretching up to 1000 au, and clumps outside the spiral arms located up to 1500 au in projection from RU Lup. We comment on potential explanations for RU Lup’s peculiar gas morphology, including gravitational instability, accretion of material onto the disk, or perturbation by another star. RU Lup’s extended non-Keplerian CO emission, elevated stellar accretion rate, and unusual photometric variability suggest that it could be a scaled-down Class II analog of the outbursting FU Ori systems.}
